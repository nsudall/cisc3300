        <!--thinking about CSS
            - imagine every element in a box, you can then apply style to shape that box
              or alter the interior text
            - CSS associates rules with HTML elements
            - 2 parts of a rule
                - selector which indicate the element the rule applies to, in front of 
                  curly bracket
                - declaration which makes the style change, inside curly bracket
                    - 2 parts of declaration
                        - property which indicates the aspect that is changed, 
                          like font, or color, before colon
                        - value, setting for the property, like arial or red, after colon
                          followed by semi colon
        -->

        <!--external CSS
            - <link> element can link to a seperate file that has all the style information
                - in the head section, couple of attributes
                - href, gives path to CSS file
                - type, give type of document, should always be text/css
                - rel, gives the relationship of the current page and linked page, should
                  always be stylesheet
                - can link multiple stylesheets, both need seperate link elements
                    - some developers use one for presentation (font, colors), and another
                      for layout
                - good for multipage websites
                    - allows all pages to be in same format
                    - rules do not need to be repeated for each page
                    - better orgainization
                    - can change style by altering the one file rather than an internal sheet
                      on each page
        -->

        <!--internal CSS
            - can have style sheet in html file inside <style> element
                - uses type attribute, value always text/css
            - should not be used if webpage is more than one page
            - good for small pages or quick tests to see how something may look
        -->

        <!--selectors
            - case sensitive, must exactly match the element or identifyer 
            - types
                - universal *{}
                    - applies to all elements
                - type h1, h2, p {}
                    - matches element names
                - class .class-value{} or p.class-value{}
                    - matches any element with class-value (first example), or type 
                      element with class-value (second example, paragraphs with class-value)
                - ID #id-value {}
                    - matches an element with the ID-value
                - Child li>a {}
                    - matches elements with proper parent/child relation
                    - in example, will style links in a list item, but not links anywhere else
                - Descendant p a {}
                    - matches any element of type within the parent type, doesn't matter number
                      of elements in between
                    - in example, any a within the p, even if the a is nested within other elements
                - Adjacent sibling h1+p {}
                    - matches elements of types that are next to each other
                    - in example, targets first p after any h1, but not other p
                - general sibling h1~p {}
                    - matches elements that are sibling of another, does not have to be the
                      direct preceding element
                    - in example, two p elements siblings of h1 element, rule applies to both
        -->

        <!--cascade
            - if multiple rules apply to the same element, this is how rule is chosen
            1. add !important to property value
                - overrides all other rules, avoid causes bugs
            2. specificity
                - the more specific selector gets priority
                - ex: id selector overrides universal
            3. last rule
                - the rule declared later will override
            - good stratagey is to start with most general default style, then override
              where needed using the rules
        -->

        <!--Inheritance
            - font and color properties inherit from parent to child
            - background-color and border properties dont
            - can force properties to inherit from their parent by making their value inherit
                - ex: padding: inherit;

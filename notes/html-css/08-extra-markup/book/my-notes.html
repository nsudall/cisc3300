        <!--id attribute
            - can be added to any element (global attribute)
            - must start with underscore or letter
            - value should be unique in each instance
            - allows for elements of the same type to be styled differently
        -->
        <p id="paragraph1">Hey there</p>
        <p id="paragraph2">Look here's another one</p>

        <!--class attribute
            - can classify multiple elements of different types
            - one element can be a member of multiple classes, just seperate value with a space
              ex: class="class1 class2"
        -->
        <p class="important">This is important</p>
        <p>not important</p>
        <h3 class="important ">This is also important</h3>

        <!--block elements
            - elements that always start on a new line
            - ex: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
        -->

        <!--inline elements
            - elements that continue on the same line as neighboring element
            - ex: <a> <b> <em> <img>
        -->

        <!--grouping text in a block
            - use <div> element
            - container, inside elements will be in block level box
            - will start on a new line
            - can add class or id attribute to formate the box
        -->
        <div id="block">
            <h1>This is in the block</h1>
            <p>So is this</p>
        </div>

        <!--grouping text inline
            - use <span> element, same as div but for inline
            - often used when applying multiple style attributes to section of text
              within larger body of text
            - often used with class or id attribute to explain the span or add style
        -->
        <p>Im gonna type a lot for <span id="do-stuff">no reason</span> so that there is
            room for me to put in this element somewhere in the middle</p>

        <!--iframe
            - is like a window into another page, can be on the same website or a different
              one, commonly used to display google maps
            - <iframe> element requires some attributes
                - src give url of the page that is supposed to be in the frame
                - hieght and width for the window dimensions 
                - scrollbars, not always supported, allows the user to move the page around
                  the frame if the accessed page is larger than the window allocated
                    - can take values yes/no to show/hide scrollbars or auto which only shows 
                      them if needed
                - frameborder, not always supported, value 0 means no border, 1 meand border
                - seamless, new way if scrolling not wanted
        -->
        <iframe width="450" height="350" 
        src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed"></iframe>

        <!--escape character
            - certain characters reserved only for code like <>
            - if you want to use them in the text, have to use little code
            - ex < is &lt; or &#60;
        -->
        <p>&lt; &#60;</p>

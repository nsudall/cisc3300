        <!--keep images in a folder-->

        <!--adding images
            - empty element
            - must have src attribute (tells where to find folder)
            - must have alt attribute (tells screen reader what the image is)
                - if the image has no meaning, like a dividing line, alt attribute will
                  have empty quotes
            - can have title attribute for additional information, displays as a tooltip
              when the user hovers
        -->
        <img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield cover to take off snow and ice"
        title="This is a present I got for Christmas" />

        <!--Image size
            - images take longer to load, giving the size allows the browser to set aside
              that space and move on to the rest of the website will the image loads
        -->
        <img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield cover to take off snow and ice"
        width="200" height="200" />

        <!--Image placement
            - determined on the location in code
            - block elements, like <p> and <h1> start on a new line, when an inline element 
              is inside a block element, then it is not started on a new line
        -->
        <!--paragraph after the image-->
        <img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield cover" />
        <p> aren't windshields pretty cool</p>

        <!--paragraph alligns with bottom edge of image-->
        <p><img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield cover" />aren't 
            windshields pretty cool</p>
        
        <!--paragraph is split around the image-->
        <p>aren't windshields <img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield 
            cover" /> pretty cool</p>
        
        <!--use CSS to allign images-->

        <!--image rules
            - use correct image format
                - use JPEG for many color variations
                - use GIF or PNG for few colors (flat colors)
                    - GIFs can have simple animations
                    - can hold transparent images
                - vector images use lines to draw logos, can be increased in size without losing
                  image quality
            - save as correct size, using html to resize can distort image and slow run time,
              measure in pixels
            - decreasing image size can spped up run time, increasing image size can result in
              blurry images, not all images can be cropped without losing information
        -->

        <!--captioins
            - <figure> element links image to the caption
            - <figcaption> creates the caption
        -->

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/car.png" alt="A car windshield cover" />
            <br />
            <figcaption>This is a present I got my dad for Christmas</figcaption>
        </figure>

1. SQL relationships are the established associations between two or more tables.
2. For every record in the primary table, there are one or more related records in the
foreign table: one-to-many
3. The join keyword allows you to request data from more than one table
4. The LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records
from the right table
5. An Aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and
returns a single value.
6. Make a new database called in_class_17. In it create tables called users and
userComments. Give them columns that you might think they would need and include a
foreign key on userComments that will reference the primary key of the users table. Give
the tables some testing data to create multiple users and user comments for some of the
users(but not all).
a. Write a query to return all users and their comments if they have comments or
not.
b. Write a query to return all users and their comments only if they have comments.

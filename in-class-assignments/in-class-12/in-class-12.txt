1. Code that is being run within a function is known as an execution context. 
2. In JavaScript variables and functions within each execution context are created 
    before they are executed, this is called Hoisting 
3. In each JavaScript execution context, the scope is the current execution context's 
    variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context, 
    this is called Closures 
4. Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the practice of bundling 
    data and methods into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting 
    direct access to some of the data 

5. Create a JavaScript function that makes use of variables from its parent 
    execution context. 
6. Create a PHP application that when a url of “/html” is accessed, some HTML code 
    is returned and displayed. If “/json” is accessed, some JSON code is returned 
    and displayed. Include screenshots for each page.

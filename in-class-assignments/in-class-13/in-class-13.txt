1. variable names start with a $ in php
2. associative arrays behave a bit like objects in JS or dictionaries in python
3. A template literal in PHP would be using a variable inside of a string
4. php is loosely typed - we donâ€™t set types for variables, they are assigned at runtime
5. The include/require statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and
copies it into the file that uses the include statement.
6. Create a PHP application that when accessed via its domain in a browser(localhost) an
HTML page is returned. On that HTML page include a button that when clicked makes
use of jQuery code to request and show data from the PHP backend.

1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target
machine. Instead, a different program, called the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
This is called an interpreted language.

2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to
change over its lifetime, this is called dynamic typing.

3. The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another is called type juggling/type coercion.

4. Non-primitive are mutable and hold references to objects stored in memory.

5. strict equal (===) Checks if two values are equal without type coercion.

6. Create a webpage that has a JavaScript component. In that Javascript component:
    1. Add a string and a number together, console.log and explain the output.
        - The counsel log is hello5, the number 5 is changed into a string concatenized onto the end of the string
    2. Run the output of the Number() function twice, once with a true boolean and once with a
       false boolean, console.log and explain the output.
        - the output for true is 1
            - The numerical value typically associated with true is 1, making it true's numerical equivalent
              (though other numerical values also are considered "true")
        - the output for false is 0
            - false is when there is nothing, the numerical equivalent of nothing is 0
    3. Run the output of the Boolean() function on 1, 0, and a string “0”, console.log and
       explain the output.
        - the output for 0 is false
        - the output for 1 is true
        - the output for "0" is true
        - This is because nothing gives the value of false. This includes 0, an empty string, and null.
          Anything that is something gives the value of true. This includes numerical values other than 0 and strings with a value
          So 0 is false because it is nothing. 1 and "0" are true because it is something, being a numerical value and a string with a value respectivly.
    4. Please take a screenshot of your browser console with the output from 1-3.

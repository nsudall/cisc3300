1. Define hoisting and closures in JS. 
    Hoisting is when variables and functions in an execution context are pushed to 
    the top so that they are created before being executed. Closure refers to 
    functions being able to remember variables and functions from outer scopes. 
    They are able to “look up” to outer scopes, but not able to “look down” into 
    child functions. 

2. What is PHP? What do server side languages do in web development? 
    PHP or PHP hypertext processor is a server side scripting language that is able
    to process user input/requests and interact with servers/databases. 

3. What are some examples of how the PHP and JavaScript programming languages are 
alike and how they differ? 
    Java script prioritizes functions, allowing for closures and high-order 
    functions, whereas php is procedural meaning that it executes linearly. Java 
    script uses prototype OOP whereas PHP is class-based OOP. Both have dynamically 
    and weakly typed variables. 

4. Why pick PHP over another server side scripting language like Python or Node? 
    PHP is relatively easy to learn and widely used for web development. Because of
    this, there is a plethora of documentation including tutorials and discussion 
    boards, again making it easy to use. A drawback of PHP is the execution speed, 
    however, newer versions have improved this issue. These advantages outweigh 
    some of the drawbacks of Python and node, like deployment problems with python 
    and callback hell in node

5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump. 
    Both are used to output values. Echo will display the given message. If a 
    variable is part of the message, then the stored value is displayed. Var_dump 
    takes a variable name, and outputs the value, variable type, and structure.

1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they
different?
    Both Flexbox and CSS grid are layout systems that help standardize layout implementation
    Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, meaning that the boxes can either flow
    vertically or horizontally. CSS grid, however, is 2 dimensional, allowing for a grid to be made
    and boxes to fill certain grid-boxes. 

2. Whatâ€™s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it?
    Resposive design allows for the layout of a webpage to alter depending on the screen
    size and orientation. This is critical for webpages to be accessible from mobile devices
    that often feature smaller screens that can be portrait or landscape. Bootstrap is a 
    common framework for implementing mobile responsiveness.

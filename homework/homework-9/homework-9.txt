1. What are relationships in SQL? Joins?
    Relationships orgainize data in a database depending on how it is related
    to another piece of data. This eases finding and accessing the data. Relationships
    are often used to link tables through common fields, often using primary and foreign key.
    Joins are able to retrieve data from multiple tables

2. How do joins and relationships interact?
    Joins are how we implement relationships between tables. For example, if one table
    holds user's information and another table holds comments, and who commented by linking
    to the user table using primary and foriegn keys. A join can be used to access
    the user's information and what they commented despite being in different tables
    due to join enacting the relationships

3. Whatâ€™s a PDO? a DSN?
    PDO are PHP data objects which help the php application connect to the database.
    Through the connection, sql queries can be sent and the returned data is stored in variables.
    DSN, or data source name, contains the information to make the connection, like 
    the database name, username, and password. 

4. What are prepared statements? Why do we need them?
    Prepared statements seperate the user input data and the sql query. This is needed
    to prevent sql injection attacks.

5. What does an .env file do?
    A .env file holds environment variables which has values set outside of the program
    We will use .env to hold the values for the database name, username, password. 
    a gitignore file should prevent these files from being uploaded onto git

6. Create a PHP project in an MVC style. It should have the ability to search for a product
type(use your fictitious business for inspiration), from a MySQL database, and display it.
Add some basic styling.
